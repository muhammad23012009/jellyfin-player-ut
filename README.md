## Godot Instructions
Steps:
1. Following the instructions on the Godot Documentation (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_pcks.html#generating-pck-files), export your project as a PCK called "appname.pck" which must be placed into this folder, overwriting the demo PCK of the same name.

2. Add the project logo/icon to th assets/ folder and change the path in the `Icon=assets/logo.svg` line in the desktop file to match that.

3. Build locally using the `clickable build` or `clickable desktop` commands, or push this project to GitLab where the clicks will be built automatically by GitLab CI.
